Generate a JSX React component that renders a structured x timetables for x sections of y branch[sections and branch are given in below data] with the following constraints:

1. The timetable should be displayed in a **table format using table tags** with **six days (Monday to Saturday)**.
2. Each day contains **n periods** [given below in data] with a **lunch break in between**.
3. Some subjects like **labs** span multiple periods [the no.of periods it will span will be mentioned below].
4. Below the main timetable, include a **"Subject Details"** table listing:
   - Subject Name
   - Faculty Name
5. The JSX should use **TailwindCSS** classes for styling.
6. The timetable should have **borders, alternating row colors, and bold headers**.

### **ðŸš€ Constraints for Timetable Generation**  
1. **Fair Workload Distribution**  
   - Ensure that **no faculty member is overloaded** with too many classes.  
   - Distribute teaching hours **evenly** among all available faculty.  

2. **No Conflicts or Overlapping Assignments**  
   - A faculty member **must not be assigned to multiple classes at the same time in any section**.  
   - If a faculty teaches multiple sections, their schedule should be arranged to **avoid clashes**.  

3. **Efficient Time Utilization**  
   - All available periods should be **utilized effectively**, ensuring that subjects and labs are scheduled optimally.  
   - Labs should span **multiple consecutive periods**, and lecture subjects should fit within the daily schedule smoothly.  

4. **consider all sections and make x timetables following these constraints with respective to other sections timetables too**

5. **makes sure there break/gap b/w each class for each lecturer**

below is the data:
make timetables for this data by following the above format in jsx:


*****NO SECTION SHOULD HAVE SAME TEACHER AT SAME TIME CONSIDERING ALL SECTIONS*****


the only thing i need is the jsx code in that we return.. no imports no exports nothing .. just the thing that we'll return in a component

example:
<div className="...">
...all the tables and all
</div>

NOTE: make sure to assign sports, library, and mentoring periods too, there is no rule that every subject should happen daily! just 3-4 classes a week for each subject is enough and in remaning time we do labs, library, sports, and mentoring.
